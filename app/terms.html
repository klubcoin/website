      ISSUED BY YOU OR US, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WHITEPAPER OR ANY
      OTHER PRESENTATION OR MARKETING DOCUMENT, WHICH ARE GIVEN FOR INFORMAITON

      THE USE OF TOKENS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLATFORM SHALL BE GOVERNED BY ALL

      (COLLECTIVELY, THE "PLATFORM TERMS AND POLICIES"). THE PLATFORM TERMS AND
      POLICIES SHALL PREVAIL, WITH RESPECT TO ANY ISSUES RELATING TO THE USE OF
      TOKENS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLATFORM, OVER THIS AGREEMENT

    <p class="content">
      NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT CONCERNING THE
      COMPANY, THE TOKENS AND THE PURCHASE AND/OR USE OF TOKENS OTHER THAN AS
      SET FORTH IN THE PLATFORM TERMS AND POLICIES. ANY SUCH STATEMENTS, IF
      MADE, MUST NOT BE RELIED UPON.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      THE OFFER AND SALE OF TOKEN MAY BE RESTRICTED IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.
      THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL OR A SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO
      BUY, NOR WILL ANY TOKEN BE OFFERED OR SOLD TO ANY PERSON IN JURISDICTIONS
      IN WHICH SUCH OFFER, SOLICITATION, PURCHASE OR SALE WOULD BE UNLAWFUL
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      THE COMPANY IS NOT SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION OR REGULATION BY ANY FINANCIAL
      MARKETS REGULATORY AUTHORITY IN ANY JURISDICTION. THE REGULATORY TREATMENT
      OF ICOS IS A LIVE AND DEVELOPING ISSUE, AND NO ASSESSMENT CAN BE
      CONSIDERED CONCLUSIVE. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THAT ITS TOKEN, GIVEN ITS
      FUNCTIONNALITIES AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 2 HEREUNDER AND ITS OPERATION AND
      IMMEDIATE FUNCTIONALITY, CONSTITUTES A "UTILITY TOKEN" ACCORDING TO MARKET
      PRACTICES AND NOT A SECURITY. AS SUCH, THE TOKENS HAVE NOT AND WILL NOT BE
      REGISTERED OR FILED UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OR REGULATIONS OF ANY
      JURISDICTION. HOWEVER, NO REGULATORY AUTHORITY HAS CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY
      OF SUCH SELF-ASSESSMENT.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      IN VIEW OF THE GUIDANCE RECENTLY RECEIVED FROM THESE REGULATORY
      AUTHORITIES, IT IS LIKELY THAT A GROWING NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS WILL BE
      CLOSELY SCRUTINIZING TOKEN SALES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT
      REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WILL NOT DETERMINE TOKENS TO BE SECURITIES SUBJECT
      TO SPECIFIC REGULATIONS. THE TOKENS HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED
      BY ANY REGULATORY AUTHORITY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, JURISDICTIONS
      THAT HAVE EXPRESSED ANY FORM OF GUIDANCE AS TO INITIAL COIN OFFERINGS AND
      TOKEN SALES, SUCH AS ABU DHABI, AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, DUBAI,
      FRANCE, GIBRALTAR, HONG KONG, ISRAEL, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIA,
      SINGAPORE, SOUTH KOREA, SWITZERLAND, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE FOREGOING
      AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY OR DETERMINED THE ADEQUACY OF
      ANY INFORMATION IN THE WHITEPAPER OR IN ANY OTHER CONTRACTUAL OR
      INFORMATION DOCUMENT RELATED TO THE ICO, NOR IS IT INTENDED THAT THE
      FOREGOING AUTHORITIES WILL DO SO.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      ALTHOUGH DUE DILIGENCE HAS BEEN CONDUCTED, AND ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS
      TAKEN ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO MITIGATE REGULATORY RISK, GIVEN THAT
      BLOCKCHAIN IS A YOUNG INDUSTRY AND GIVEN THE RAPIDLY CHANGING REGULATORY
      LANDSCAPE AND WARNINGS SIGNALED BY MULTIPLE INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS
      REGARDING THE POTENTIAL FOR ICOS TO BE VIEWED AS SECURITIES OFFERINGS,
      THERE IS A RISK THAT THE TOKENS SOLD BY THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE PRECLUDED
      FROM SECURITIES REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS IN ALL JURISDICTIONS. MANY
      INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE INDICATED THAT TOKEN SALES MAY QUALIFY AS
      SALES OF INVESTMENT CONTRACTS OR PUBLI OFFERINGS.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY WOULD BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. SHOULD
      TOKENS BE DEEMED SECURITIES BY ANY REGULATORY AUTHORITY, THE COMPANY AND
      ANY TOKEN PURCHASER MAY BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      AS A RESULT, PROSPECTIVE TOKEN PURCHASERS SHALL CONSULT THEIR OWN ADVISERS
      AS TO (I) THE POSSIBLE LEGAL, TAX, ACCOUNTING, PRUDENTIAL AND FINANCIAL
      CONSEQUENCES WITHIN THEIR COUNTRIES OF CITIZENSHIP, RESIDENCE, DOMICILE
      AND PLACE OF BUSINESS WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUISITION, HOLDING, USE AND/OR
      DISPOSAL OF TOKENS, AND (II) ANY FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY BE
      RELEVANT THERETO IN ORDER TO ENSURE, IN PARTICULAR, THAT (I) THEY ARE
      LEGALLY AUTHORISED TO PURCHASE AND USE TOKENS, AND (II) THE PURCHASE
      AND/OR USE OF TOKENS IS NOT CONTRARY TO ANY OTHER STATUTORY OR REGULATORY
      RESTRICTIONS THAT THEY MAY BE SUBJECT TO.
