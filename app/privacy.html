    </p>
    <p class="content">
      The THE KLUB team does every possible effort to keep your trust; and thus
      we adhere to these general privacy principles, in order to defend your
      privacy:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>THE KLUB does not rent or sell your PI.</li>
      <li>
        THE KLUB does not divulge your contact information to third parties or
        other users without your consent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any PI that you give to THE KLUB will be protected by industry standard
        technology and codes of ethics.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="content">
      For purposes of this Policy, the Site/App shall be the initial point of
      contact between you and THE KLUB, and will serve as the point of
      collection of any personal data you may provide us.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      As our user, you will normally be able to manage and select the quantity
      and type of PI you may reveal to us when using our Site/App, usually in
      your account settings.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      We constantly try to develop our user experience, and continuously work in
      order to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        notify you concerning the ways in which your personal information may be
        utilized and shared (overseas included);
      </li>
      <li>
        preserve the security and protection of your personal details; and/or
      </li>
      <li>
        enforce the accessibility of your personal information in order for you
        to exercise your right of correction of said information.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="title">Collection of Personal Information.</p>
    <p class="content">
      As a general rule, we collect both "Non-Personal Information" and
      "Personal Information" from our users:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Non-Personal Information" includes information that cannot be used to
        personally identify an individual person, such as anonymous usage data,
        general demographic information that we may collect, number of clicks,
        platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are
        generated based on the data you submit.
      </li>
      <li>
        "Personal Information" includes information that can be used to
        personally identify an individual person, such as name, address, email
        address, home/business address, mobile number and payment processing
        account details
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="content">
      More specifically, though the Site/App, we collect PI through our contact
      forms, including but not limited to, name, surname, company name, artistic
      name, pseudonym, email, profile picture, company email address, personal
      mobile number, company phone number, client lists, client contact details,
      order & project data, customer management data, Skype username and
      LinkedIn profile.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      We may also collect non-personally identifiable information via third
      party tools, such as aggregate user statistics, analytics, demographic
      information, and web Site/App usage information. As our user, you will
      generally be able to control and select the amount and type of PI you may
      disclose to us.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      Accordingly, by registering with us or otherwise using our products and
      services, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage,
      and disclosure of your PI as described in this Policy.
    </p>
    <p class="title">User Credentials.</p>
    <p class="content">
      Users may use their email address in order to login into the Site/App,
      along with other single sign on authentication services such as those
      provided by Facebook, Twitter, SoundCloud and others. Henceforth, the
      Site/App might provide an option of using your social media credentials
      and, thus, by such action, we will collect your PI as given by such third
      party platforms, but never more than the PI these platforms disclose.
      Collected PI will include, but will not be limited to, friend lists,
      email, image gallery, likes and other information. If you close your
      social media account, or if you deauthorize our access, your access to our
      Site/App may be suspended. For more information, please read the terms and
      policies of such third party platforms.
    </p>
    <p class="title">Purpose of PI Collection.</p>
    <p class="content">
      We will store your PI for the purposes of managing your collaboration with
      other users and clients, improve your user experience, send newsletters
      and contact you about inquiries for our services. Overall, we use the
      collected PI to provide and improve our services. Accordingly, we will
      generally collect, use and disclose your PI to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provide, operate, maintain, improve, and promote our platform and our
        products and services.
      </li>
      <li>Verify your e-mail address and other account notices.</li>
      <li>Develop, research, process, safeguard and improve our services.</li>
      <li>
        Offer promotions, newsletters, sweepstakes entries, send service related
        announcements and contact you about inquiries for our products and
        services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions, unauthorized access to
        our services, and other suspicious activities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our
        products and services and for marketing or advertising purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="content">
      THE KLUB will keep any collected PI only as long as it is necessary, with
      regard to the purpose of its processing. This means that PI collected and
      processed for marketing and commercial purposes will be stored for as long
      as you have an active account, and for twelve (12) months after your
      subscription has ended or where your account has been deleted or
      deactivated.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      If you do not wish to disclose any or part of your PI to us, you may still
      be able to use some of the functionalities of our Site/App, though we will
      not be able to guarantee that you will be able to enjoy them at their
      fullest if you elect not to disclose it to us.
    </p>
    <p class="title">Disclosures to Business Successors.</p>
    <p class="content">
      If our business is sold or merges in whole or in part with another
      business that would become responsible for providing the Site/App to you,
      we retain the right to transfer your PI to the new business. The new
      business would retain the right to use your PI according to the terms of
      this Policy as well as to any changes to this privacy notice as instituted
      by the new business.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      We will also retain the right to transfer your PI if our company files for
      bankruptcy and some or all of our assets are sold to another individual or
      business.
    </p>
    <p class="title">Third Party Tools and PI Processors.</p>
    <p class="content">

      processing of your PI due to the provision of our service and will inform
      you of any intended material changes concerning the addition or
      replacement of sub-processors before such changes are effective, thereby

      as having the ability to be or cause a predicament or hazard to us.

    <p class="title">Newsletter Subscription.</p>
    <p class="content">
      Occasionally, we will ask you for express permission and approval to

    <p class="content">
      We will send you service-related announcements on occasions when it is
      necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended

      way you use our services, we might send you an email. Generally, you may
      not opt-out of these communications, which are neither commercial nor
      promotional in nature.
    </p>
