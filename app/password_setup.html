      <h1>Password Setup</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="content">
      Once you've downloaded and installed the Klub Coin app, you'll arrive at
      the first selection screen.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      If this is your first time setting up your Klub Coin wallet, you will
      start with the "Create a Wallet" option. If you have a previous existing
      Klub Coin wallet and are willing to import it, please select the "Import
      wallet" options.
    </p>
    <p class="title">Create a Wallet</p>
    <p class="content">
      Once you've selected the option to create a new wallet, you'll be asked to
      fill in some data infomation and to create a password. You will use this
      password to sign in to your Klub Coin wallet mobile app. Although this is
      <i>not</i> your private key/seed phrase, you want to save it in a safe
      place, just as with any pasword.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      The next step after selecting a password <i>does</i> involve your seed
      phrase, also called "secret recovery phrase".<b>
        Please pay attention to this step</b
      >. You will receive a randomly generated string of words and will be asked
      to confirm this phrase by entering it back into the app. While you do
      this, write down your secret recovery phrase and keep it in a safe place.
      Once confirmed, you'll arrive at the main page of your Klub Coin wallet.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      Please consider storing your seed phrase by physically writing it down in
      a notebook or on a notepad and save it somewhere safe and offline, or use
      a password manager to encrypt your password and phrase. Saving your phrase
      anywhere on your computer (Word doc, text file, etc.) could leave you
      vulnerable to hacks and scams, we strongly advise you to avoid this.
    </p>
    <p class="title">Import Wallet</p>
    <p class="content">
      If importing an existing wallet by selecting the "Import wallet" option,
      you'll get a prompt to enter a private key (seed phrase) which is the
      "secret recovery phrase" that you wrote down when you first created your
      wallet.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      Re-enter carefully each word one by one in the to restore you wallet.
    </p>
    <p class="title">Configure Settings</p>
    <p class="content">
      Take a moment to explore and configure your new wallet's settings. To
      access the general settings page, click the setting wheel icon in the
      menu. Fields such as your account username and contact details can be
      edited from the settings page.
