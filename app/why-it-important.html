      When you start using your Klub Coin wallet, you will receive a random set
      of 12 words. This is also referred to as your Recovery Phrase. It is a key
      element when using a hardware wallet and must be kept safe and offline at
      all times.
    </p>
    <p class="titleImpotant">WHY A RECOVERY PHRASE?</p>
    <p class="content">
      Recovery phrases, also called seed phrases, are absolutely essential when
      using a hardware wallet. If your app or phone becomes unusable for any
      reason (theft or destruction), you have not lost your precious
      cryptocurrencies. Your 12 words serve as a backup for all cryptocurrencies
      managed through your device.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      Let us say your phone is lost and you want to have access to your
      cryptocurrencies again. When you start your new device, you will have the
      option to select "Restore from Recovery Phrase". After you enter all 12
      words correctly, your device will give you access to the exact same
      addresses as before!
    </p>
    <p class="titleImpotant">HOW DOES IT WORK?</p>
    <p class="content">
      Your recovery phrase can be considered as a master key. As you may have
      already guessed, there is a specific list of words that can be part of
      your recovery phrase. There are 2048 words in total in this list, which is
      also called the BIP-39 word list.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      If you are worried that someone might guess your 12 words, do not worry.
      There is a huge total of 5444517870735015415413993718908291383296
      combinations!!! You're more likely to win the lottery every month for the
      rest of your life.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      Even though your recovery phrase is presented to you as a series of words,
      it is actually a long string of data that looks similar to a
      cryptocurrency address. For your convenience, these are displayed as
      human-readable words.
    </p>
    <p class="titleImpotant">KEEP IT SECRET & SAFE!</p>
    <p class="content">
      As mentioned earlier, your 12-word recovery phrase is a backup for all
      your crypto wallet. This also means that anyone who gets their hands on
      your 12 words can access your cryptocurrencies. Therefore, it is extremely
      important that you keep your Recovery Phrase safe.
    </p>
    <p class="content">The following steps can help you do that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Never share your 12-word recovery phrase with anyone</li>
      <li>
        Never enter your recovery phrase into a computer, phone or any other
        internet-connected device. If your computer would get hacked, the
        attacker would be able to access your 12 words.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only keep your recovery phrase on a piece of paper or metal backup.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="content">
      Making sure to follow these simple rules will help keep your wallet and
      cryptocurrencies safe.
    </p>
    <p class="titleImpotant">ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK</p>
    <p class="content">
      Apart from keeping your recovery phrase safe, it is also important that
      you have your 12 words written down correctly. Any mistake in spelling or
      word order would result in a different set of addresses being generated
      and would not restore your precious assets.
